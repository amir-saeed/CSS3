### Animation

An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.To use CSS3 animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

### Transformation

### Transitions

CSS transitions allow us to animate CSS properties from an original value to a new
value over time when a property value changes.
